Monty Python’s Life of Brian still stands up as an amazing achievement, the Pythons’ masterpiece: a 90-minute sketch elevated to an entirely consistent, hugely audacious and ambitious film, shot in Tunisia on sets used for Zeffirelli’s Jesus of Nazareth, with £3m of George Harrison’s money provided after EMI Films nervously withdrew its backing. There are tremendously funny set pieces and brilliant visual moments. The point-of-view shot of Brian’s mother as she opens the window to see the ecstatic masses outside her hovel, is superb.
