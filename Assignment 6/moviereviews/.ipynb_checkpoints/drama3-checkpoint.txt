At times, Steven Knight’s script over-eggs its imagery, not least in a recurrent motif about pheasants being “beautiful but not very bright” birds bred for shooting or a subplot about Bertie the scarecrow wearing the coat of Diana’s “Papa”. There are also visions of Anne Boleyn, who was beheaded so that her royal husband could replace her with another woman; amid the madness of royal life her presence seems weirdly unintrusive. More affecting is an ecstatic montage in which Stewart dances her way through the chapters of Diana’s life, ballet and bops breaking into a running canter as the whiff of freedom presents itself.
